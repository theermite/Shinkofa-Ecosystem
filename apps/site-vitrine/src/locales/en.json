        "answer": "Absolutely. Shinkofa was created BY a neurodivergent person who has been coaching for almost 15 years and is passionate about understanding humans. Jay (Splenic Projector 1/3, multipotentialite Gifted) created Shinkofa FOR neurodivergent individuals. Our entire family of 6 is neuroatypical. We live the challenges you face daily. Every feature is designed to respect your energy cycles, cognitive overload, and unique functioning."

        "question": "I don't have time to answer 155 questions...",
        "answer": "We understand. The full questionnaire takes about 1 hour. But you can do it in multiple sessions: the questionnaire automatically saves your progress. You're not required to complete everything in one sitting. And this hour will help you better understand yourself for YEARS. A minimal investment for maximum impact."

        "question": "Is my data secure?",
        "answer": "Yes, 100%. Your data belongs to you. European hosting (GDPR compliant), end-to-end encryption. Your data will never be sold or used for commercial purposes. IF this rule changes, all users will be notified and it will only be done with explicit user consent. You can export or delete your data at any time. We respect your digital sovereignty."
      },
      "q4": {
        "question": "Why pay when free apps exist?",
        "answer": "Free apps sell your data or flood you with ads. Shinkofa is ethical: your subscription funds feature development, not the resale of your personal information. We believe in a transparent model: you pay for quality service, not to be the product. On The Shinkofa Way, the user will never be the product, they will be recognized for their individuality."
